    If you want to use special characters like <strong>&lt;</strong>, <strong>&gt;</strong>, <strong>&amp;</strong>, or <strong>&apos;</strong> in your HTML, it is necessary to use &quot;character entity references&quot;.

      Here is a hummus recipie (to give me more practice with HTML):
    </p>

  <p>
    Quick hummus recipe
  </p>
  <p>
    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ingredients
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Instructions
  </p>
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
  <p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Storage
  </p>
  <p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
